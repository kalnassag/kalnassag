## G'day Mate

I'm currently working towards my Masters of Computer Science at Queensland University of Technology, returning to the field after a very long time spent away from programming since gradutation.
I admit that I'm very rusty, but I'm working on refreshing my skills and relearing the new technologies out there.

I've been working adjacent to software development as a localisation manager, and I want to learn more about i18n and its practical applications.

I'm looking to collaborate on anything i18n and AI prompting, I'm particulartly interested in RTL (Right to Left) support in general, and Arabic in particular.

You can reach me on kalnassag@proton.me.
